/**
 * A heuristic P&R approach based on migorthogonal graph drawing. A slight modification of
 * Therese C. Biedl's improved algorithm for drawing of 3-graphs is used because the original
 * one works for undirected graphs only. Modification includes using directions of the logic network
 * directly instead of relabeling the edges according to its DFS tree, ordering the vertices
 * using jDFS instead of DFS, and adding an extra placement rule for nodes without predecessors.
 *
 * The algorithm works in linear time O(2|V| + |E|). Produced layout has a size of x * y, where
 * x + y = |V| - |PI| + 1. This is because each vertex leads to either one extra row or column
 * except for those without predecessors which create both.
